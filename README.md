# Spatial Query Processing


## Motivation
- For example a videographer wants to record a movie using a drone
- The videographer wants to record some landmarks while flying the drone from one location to another
- As a drone has a limited battery lifespan, the videographer has to make sure that all the landmarks are recorded before it reaches the destination
- Thus he has to plan an efficient path for the drone


## Description
- Using Delone Triangulation, drawing a visibile path for the shortest path to a flying object, including a drones
- Applied 3D data to the San Francisco load network in a distributed environment
- It was a study on three dimensional Euclidean space such as drone, not a study on the load network which occupied the mainstream


## Problem Solving
- Improved the method of selecting the shortest existing point as a starting point by grasping the cluster distribution of data
- This improve the processing speed of the system by 7% and then published theis on this subject.


## Technique
- Delaunay triangulation
- Voronoi diagram
- Dijkstra's algorithm
